# First Programming Assignment

## Group A: Question 1
When adding two floats the time and ticks observed were about two times longer than the time and ticks it took to add two doubles. 

## Group B: Question 3
by far direct multiplication takes the most time out of any function at about 3.5 seconds. 
The direct multiplication function elevates n amount of times that the enumber in the first array, 
so it makes sense that it takes more time with so many numbers being processed. The math.Pow function takes about 5 miliseconds when n is 80000,
and is done the quickest even after the Math.sqrt function which takes about 6.5 seconds
